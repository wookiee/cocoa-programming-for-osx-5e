# Cocoa Programming for macOS, 5th Edition

This branch contains solutions for Swift 5.0 and the companion guide for Swift 2.0.  If you are using Swift 1.2, see [the swift1-2 branch](../../tree/swift1-2).

## Solutions and Errata

This repository contains the solutions and errata for [Cocoa Programming for OS X - The Big Nerd Ranch Guide][book],
5th Edition, by Aaron Hillegass, Adam Preble, and Nate Chandler.

Solutions for exercises can be found in the folder corresponding to that chapter.
Solutions to challenges are not provided, but we encourage you to discuss your
challenge solution (or quest for a solution!) on the [forum for this book][forum].

[`Errata.md`](./Errata.md) contains a list of all errata that have
been found in the book. If you think you have found a bug, please make a post
on [the forum][forum].

This edition was written for Xcode 6.3 on OS X Yosemite 10.10 with Swift 1.2.
As with any technology, as Apple releases new versions you may encounter surprises.
Where possible we will update the errata to call attention to these changes.

## Swift 2 Transition Guide

At WWDC 2015, Apple announced Xcode 7 and Swift 2, both of which introduce 
significant updates. Those changes, and to a lesser extent changes to Cocoa for 
OS X 10.11, necessitate a companion guide for using Xcode 7 to work through 
the exercises in the book.  That companion guide is [here](./Swift2.md).
